Data Structure, done through The Odin Project.
Although Linked Lists arent required in Ruby, the exercise aimed
to grow familiarality with the data structure.

This exercise was useful for refreshing on working with classes,
and how the data structure works, and how to manipulate the next node
of the linked elements.

Following on from linked lists, the binary tree was an exercise in 
creating and manipulating nodes of a binary tree. The code at present,
especially the delete method, is a bit long winded and I intend to
come back at a later date to see if this can be condensed while
retaining readability.

N.B. The pretty print method was provided by The Odin Project
     and made by a previous student.
