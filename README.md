Exercise working with linked lists, done through The Odin Project.
Although Linked Lists arent required in Ruby, the exercise aimed
to grow familiarality with the data structure.

This exercise was useful for refreshing on working with classes,
and how the data structure works, and how to manipulate the next node
of the linked elements.
